We are given an input array of meeting time intervals, intervals, where each interval has a start time and an end time. Your task is to find the minimum number of meeting rooms required to hold these meetings.

> An important thing to note here is that the specified end time for each meeting is exclusive.

Constraints
- 1 ≤ intervals.length ≤ 10ˆ3
- 0 ≤ starti < endi ≤ 10ˆ6
