Given the head of a linked list, determine the length of the cycle present in the linked list. If there is no cycle, return 0.
A cycle exists in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0,10ˆ4].
- −10ˆ5 ≤ Node.value ≤ 10ˆ5
