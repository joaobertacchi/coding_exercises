You are given a string sentence that may contain leading or trailing spaces, as well as multiple spaces between words. Your task is to reverse the order of the words in the sentence without changing the order of characters within each word. Return the resulting modified sentence as a single string with words separated by a single space, and no leading or trailing spaces.

> Note: A word is defined as a continuous sequence of non-space characters. Multiple words separated by single spaces form a valid English sentence. Therefore, ensure there is only a single space between any two words in the returned string, with no leading, trailing, or extra spaces.

Constraints:
- The sentence contains English uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and spaces.
- There is at least one word in a sentence.
- 1 ≤ sentence.length ≤ 10ˆ4
