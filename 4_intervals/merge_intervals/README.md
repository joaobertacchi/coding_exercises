We are given an array of closed intervals called intervals, where each interval has a start time and an end time and is represented as intervals[i] = [starti, endi]. Your task is to merge the overlapping intervals and return a new output array consisting of only the non-overlapping intervals.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ intervals.length ≤ 10ˆ3
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 0 ≤ starti ≤ endi ≤ 10ˆ4
