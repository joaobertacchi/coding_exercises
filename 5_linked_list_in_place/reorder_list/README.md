Given the head of a singly linked list, reorder the list as if it were folded on itself. For example, if the list is represented as follows:
- L0 → L1 → L2 → … → Ln−2 → Ln−1 → Ln

This is how you’ll reorder it:
- L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln−1 → L2 → Ln−2 → …

You don’t need to modify the values in the list’s nodes; only the links between nodes need to be changed.

Constraints:
- The range of number of nodes in the list is [1,500].
- −5000 ≤ Node.value ≤ 5000
